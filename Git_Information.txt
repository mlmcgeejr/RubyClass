Git Notes

I could not get my updates to go to my repository.
I kept getting the following messages
"Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind 
 its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. git pull) before pushing again.

I Goggled the error messages until I landed on a site
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25237959/updates-were-rejected-because-the-tip-of-your-current-branch-is-behind-hint-its

It said to issue a   git pull

When I did this, I got another error message that read:

"There is no tracking information for the current branch. 
  Please specify which branch you want to merge with."

I Googled that error message    and   walla  and landed on the following website
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10147475/git-checkout-tag-git-pull-fails-in-branch

It said that if I wish to enter tracking information for this branch, I can do so with the
following git command

git branch --set-upstream master origin/master

then I did a git pull - and it merged by branches together (I think)

After that my git push worked!
